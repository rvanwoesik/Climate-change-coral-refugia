# Climate-change-coral-refugia

10.1111/gcb.12851

This study sought to identify climate-change thermal-stress refugia for reef corals in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. A
species distribution modeling approach was used to identify refugia for 12 coral species that differed considerably in
their local response to thermal stress. We hypothesized that the local response of coral species to thermal stress might
be similarly reflected as a regional response to climate change. We assessed the contemporary geographic range of
each species and determined their temperature and irradiance preferences using a k-fold algorithm to randomly
select training and evaluation sites. That information was applied to downscaled outputs of global climate models to
predict where each species is likely to exist by the year 2100. Our model was run with and without a 1 Â°C capacity to
adapt to the rising ocean temperature.
